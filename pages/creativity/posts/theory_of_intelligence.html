      <strong>Theories of Intelligence and Thought</strong><br>
      In this occasion I will talk about one of the most important contemporary
      topics, which are the theroies of intelligence and tought. Understanding
      our process of thought, categorizing our intelligence are key to understanding
      ourselves and most importantly our strengths.<br>
      During the presentation of my classmates one theory took my attention Sternberg's Triarchic
      Theory of Intelligence, I strongly believe in the rule of three, many things can be
      generalized in three categories, or three reasons. Henceforth I will focus on
      Sternberg's theory.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Sternberg's Triarchic Theory of Intelligence</strong><br>
      This theory was formulated by Rober J. Sternberg, a prominent figure in resaearch
      of human intelligence. The thery objective was to go againts the psychometric approach
      to intelligence and a more cognitive approach. He dividided the theory in:
      Analytic intelligence, Creative intelligence and Practical intelligence.
      <br>
      Lets start with <i>Analytic intelligence</i> this kind of intelligence it's strongly
      related with abstract thinking and logical reasoning, it's our ability to obtain information
      from the enviroment and any other data source. Verbal and mathematical skill are born from
      this kind intelligence, it is possible to learn mathematics with out analysing but the you
      are only doing mechanical thinking to truly understand and apply math you need to process
      information and analyze the problem in order to solve it.<br>
      Theres also <i>Practical intelligence</i> this ability regards to our capability to react
      to the enviroment and to adapt that enviroment to our own needs. This ability is originated since
      the beginning of humanity when early humans had to survive in a dangerous enviroment. <br>
      Lest but not least <i>Creative intelligence</i> this type of intelligence happens when a person
      approaches a new information or task, it also invovles the person's ability to apply existing
      knowledge to new problems. I personally think that this ability is fundamental to innovation
      someone whose not creative has a rough time coming up with ideas. <br><br>
      <strong>To conclude</strong><br>
      I think that Sternberg's theroy its a good way to generalize intelligence, regarding the performance
      of my classmates I think it was well excecuted; The teachers activity (which consisted of throwing
      stuff from the sealing at the same time, and guessing which one will fall first) was pretty spot on
      becuase it made us think about many factors.

       <strong>Thinking Skills and Types of Thinking</strong><br>
       Today we had a presentation about thinking skills & types of thinking, I took interest in
       logical thinking since its a skill that engineers need to develop
       as explained by them:<br>
       <i>"When we say that something is logical, what we actually mean is that it makes sense.
       Logical reasoning skills are the ability to focus on the presented task by
       following the chain of the thought process by relating one statement after another,
       until finding the most logical conclusion."</i>-Quoted from their document.<br><br>
       <strong>Why I think logical thinking is important?</strong><br>
       Regarding to logical thinking, I strongly believe that logical thinking is an evolution
       of common-sense because, the more we train our common-sense the more logical it becomes.<br>
       Logical thinking lets us figure out relationships, differences and most importantly
       patterns. Math describes those patterns, and generalizes them in a language we all are
       capable of learning trough practice an training.<br><br>
       <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
       Is logical thinking fundamental? Yes, it the soul reason we are able to communicate via
       the internet since it was created by circuit logic, I think that each one of us should indeed
       atleast put an effort to train this marvelous skill.

       <strong>Basic Thinking Skills</strong><br>
       My team had the responsability to explain the topic "Basic Thinking Skills",
       as the name implies basic thinking skills are innate tools we have as a human
       since we are born. <br>
       We use these tools in our everyday-life without being aware of them. <br>
       We have five basic thinking skills, hence I will explain:<br><br>
       <i>Observation</i><br>
       Is our ability to explore, watch, look, etc. our enviroment we mostly observe through
       eyes but also other organs have the ability to gain information from the enviroment.<br>
       <i>Keyconcepts</i>:Collecting data, Understanding the enviroment <br>
       E.g: Observing a bird flying and logging it's flight path.<br><br>
       <i>Description</i><br>
       To understand what a descrption is first we must know what "describe" means
       <i>"It is to give a written or spoken report of how something is done or
        something is like"</i>, so description is something already described.
        Descrption I would say is our most important skill because it
        allowed human beings to transfer detailed information from human to human. <br>
        E.g: Your description of Della was hilarious. <br><br>
        <i>Comparison</i><br>
        A skill used to examine two objects, ideas or situations, to discover likenesses or differences.<br>
        To be exact to compare we need to have two subjects with a similar characteristic.<br>
        E.g: Compare the flavo of a red apple and a green apple. <br><br>
        <i>Relationship</i><br>
        As a skill, relatioship means: the ability, tools, kowledge, knowing and understanding to create,
        communicate, evolve, grow, truste and maintain a relationship. <br>
        E.g: Relationships are complicated, because we ae complicated.<br><br>
        <i>Classification</i><br>
        Is to arrenge (a group of people or things) in classes or categories accoridng to shared
        qualities or characteristics. What is a class?: A set or category of things having
        some property or attribute in common and differentiated from other kind, type, or quality.<br><br>
        E.g: Classify legos by shape and color.<br><br>
        <i>To conclude</i><br>
        The activities we prepared for each had a bit of tought behind it made them realize those abilities
        and I belive we succedded in giving a good presentation, regarding this topic I think that refining our
        basic skills is upmost importance because as we do more complex stuff our mistakes from the bases
        carry over to our final objective. It is important to remember that everything comes from dots to shape.

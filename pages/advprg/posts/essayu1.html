        <strong>Introduction</strong><br>
        In this post I'm going to talk about Software Development Models,
        since I've been working on some coding projects I can certainly say
        that following one is a most.<br>
        Not so long ago I worked on developing an automated plantpot and,
        it was a nightmare to do colaborative coding with my partner, I was a rookie
        back then.<br>
        I came to the realization that without tools like git doing colaborative coding
        would be practically impossible since no one in the team would know which line
        was altered nor which is the newest version of the code. In any case we have been
        coding for almost 60 years and as time went on we developed tools and models to
        ease these issues.<br>

        <strong>Even before choosing a model!</strong><br>
        It is important to know some tips about coding before choosing your model
        since in many cases even if you follow a model step by step, rule by rule
        you might become a hassle.
        Here are some tips you can follow:<br><br>
        <i>The reason it all exist</i><br>
        Everything you code must have a purpose e.g Var Tacos = Delicious,
        If you dont plan on using tacos on your program, then why have them in the
        first place?.<br><br>
        <i>Keep It Simple, Stupid!</i><br>
        Keep in mind what you are coding, nothing should be sensless e.g Var Tacos =
        Quesadillas, Tacos are tacos it is ilogical to asign them the value of quesadillas.<br><br>
        <i>Maintain the vision</i><br>
        If you are coding a software for a food  restaurant, don't add car features.<br><br>
        <i>What you produce, others will consume</i><br>
        Ohter people might need to use your code, so make it understandable for as many as
        you can.<br><br>
        <i>Be open to the future</i><br>
        Life evolves an so code evolves, new OS, technologies, etc. Your code might need to change later!.<br><br>
        <i>Plan ahead for reuse</i><br>
        Code having in mind that you can reuse many functions and variables.<br><br>
        <i>Think!</i><br>
        You should think about the problem, don't try solving it without a thought.

          <strong>Models they flow!</strong><br>
          <i>Linear Process Flow</i><br>
          <img class="col-md round" src="../../../img/lpf.jpg"></img><br>
          Like the name implies all the process is fixed, since the very
          beginning.<br><br>
          <i>Iterative Process Flow</i><br>
          <img class="col-sm round" src="../../../img/ipf.jpg"></img><br>
          In contrast to the linear process, you can go back to the beginning in many stages.<br><br>
          <i>Evolutionary Process Flow</i><br>
          <img class="col-sm round" src="../../../img/epf.jpg"></img><br>
          The evolutionary process works by adding into each iteration.<br><br>
          <i>Parallel Process Flow</i><br>
          <img class="col-sm round" src="../../../img/ppf.jpg"></img><br>
          In the parallel process many things happen at once.

          <strong>The models themselves</strong><br>
          <i>The waterfall model</i><br>
          <img class="col-sm-8 round" style="background-color:white;" src="../../../img/wfm.png"></img><br>
          This was the first model to be published in 1970, it follows a linear process flow.<br>
          Before ending one waterfall all the members must have ended their work, it's measured in
          n waterfalls. <br><br>
          <i>Incremental model</i><br>
          <img class="col-sm-8 round" src="../../../img/icm.png"></img><br>
          Based on both linear and parallel flow, in this model each increment it's a functional product since the beginning, it's agile and
          models like scrum are based on this model. This model reinforces communication with the client
          because in each increment a feedback is evaluated. Many websites are based on this model.<br><br>
          <i>Spiral model</i><br>
          <img class="col-sm-8 round" style="background-color:white;" src="../../../img/spm.png"></img><br>
          This model functions with a set amount of spirals (incremental/iterative) each spiral starts
          the process from the beginning, it's not time efficient but has a much
          refined final product because it takes explicit recognition of risk with in the process.<br><br>
          <i>Prototype model</i><br>
          <img class="col-sm-8 round" src="../../../img/ppm.png"></img><br>
          It's an evolutionary model, it is used to hasten the developing process of a product
          by making prototypes to prove concepts, this model is widely used in engineering
          because of it's trial and error nature. The model is not cost efficient and many
          problems can be carried over from previous evolutions.

            <strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
            Knowing how software models are implmented is a must nowadays, in order to follow industry standards,
            from personal experience working with embedded systems and web development it is nearly impossible
            to work in teams without these tools.<br>
            When working on embedded systems most likely you end up using the prototype model, and the code
            will get messy after a some iterations of the product. When I was working on an automated plantpot
            I ran into many problems showing the code to my partner, that caused our work to be splitted and
            developed individually resulting in a product full of errors and bad decisions.<br>
            Software development models exist so these errors don't occur as often, choosing the right model to
            follow can be the difference between a succesful product or a complete failure.
